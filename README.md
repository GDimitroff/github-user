## Getting Started

In order to setup and work on this project on your own, you will need to:

1. Clone this project:  
   `git clone https://github.com/GDimitroff/github-user.git`

2. Once you have cloned this project, you can install the required dependencies by using:  
   `npm install`

3. A live demo of the project can be started by using:  
   `npm start`

4. Distribution files can be produced using:  
   `npm run build`

5. You will need to create **Firebase** account and follow the instructions in their documentation in order authentication to work.

## Features

- Data is **dynamically loaded** via GitHub's API.
- **Authentication**.
- **Routing**.
- **Fully responsive**.
- **Fancy charts** provided by FusionCharts
- When signing in with GitHub the app displays your own info and stats first before allowing you to search for different user.

## Outcome

- Deepened knowledge of using **useEffect** hook.
- Deepened knowledge of using **useCallback** hook.
- Deepened knowledge of using **context** for the global state management.
- Used **react-router**.
- Used **FusionCharts** for the fancy charts.
- Used **Firebase** services for authentication.
- Used **react-firebase-hooks** which in the end was overkill.
- Used global CSS styles in combination with **styled components**.
- Used **axios** and learned a lot about error handling.
- Tried to keep file structure as clean as possible.
- Deepened knowledge of using third party libraries.
- Overall, I have improved my learning abilities A LOT! ðŸ§
